# NoteGame
This is my first personal project that continues from my previous coding course training, and this project is planned to have some experimental features, this project will be very long and very long because I still need a lot to learn, I hope I can finish it soon

The name of this application is NoteGame, which should make it easier for gamers to see the latest games.

#Application built using
-Retrofit
-Dependency Injection With Koin
-Modularation
-MVVM
-Coroutines Flow

#Notice
This project is still not completely correct, because there are bugs that I haven't been able to fix, and also the features of the rest api that I use are very limited so I'm thinking of discontinuing this project, but if I have free time I will continue it again.
